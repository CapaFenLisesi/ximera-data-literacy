\begin{abstract}
  The point here is to include some programming exercises.
\end{abstract}

\begin{exercise}
Given that $s(k)=-k^2-4 k+2$, evaluate $s(4.5)$. Express your answer in decimal notation.
\begin{solution}
\begin{hint}
$s(4.5)=-(4.5)^2-4 (4.5)+2$.
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
$s(4.5)=-36.25$.
\end{hint}
The value of the function $s(k)=-k^2-4 k+2$, evaluated at $k=4.5$, is \answer{-36.25}.
\end{solution}

Here is some text after the first problem.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Given that $s(k)=-k^2-4 k+2$, evaluate $s(4.5)$. Express your answer in decimal notation.

\begin{python-scaffold}
  def f(x):
    # this is where you should include your code
    return x
\end{python-scaffold}

The scaffold has been scaffolded.

\begin{python-validator}
  def validator():
    return 1
\end{python-validator}

So you did it.  Great!
\end{exercise}
