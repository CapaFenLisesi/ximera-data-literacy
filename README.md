Data Literacy Course
===========================

This is a [Ximera](ximera.osu.edu) course aimed at the general population to develop their data literacy. This course will cover things such as:

* cause and effect
  * correlations
  	* Anscombe's quartet
  	* Simpson's paradox
  	* correlations in compositional data
  	* unintended consequences
  	  * homebuyer's tax credit inflated prices by more than the credit?
  	  * Braess' paradox
  	  * rabbit explosion in Australia
  	* how likely is it?
  	  * null hypothesis
  	    * pareto distribution from exchange of 1 dollar at random in 
  	      fully connected network (economy)
  	    * urban segregation by income (Hoyt model, Burgess model) from agent-based model
		  Urban segregation as a complex system, Feitosa
		  Ecology and Development Series No. 70, 2010
  	  * model believing
  	  * Occam's Razor
* common logical fallacies
  * spurious correlations (http://www.tylervigen.com/)
  * https://bookofbadarguments.com/
* estimation
	* orders of magnitude
	  * viability
	  	* is this claim actually possible
	  	* what would the consequences of this claim be
	  * absolute vs relative measurements
	  	* percent increase from a small number to a slightly larger small number
  	  	* percent increase from large number to a slightly larger large number
  	  * averages and variance: small samples vs large samples
  	  	* math dept 2 players, ec dept 20 players, music 5 players in NCAA tourneys
  	  	  small depts: tend to do max, min (since effect of each player is larger)
  	  	  large depts: tend to do about average (since effect of each player is smaller)
* biases
  * selection bias vs treatment
  * confirmation bias
  	* self-fulfilling prophecies
  	* motivation, goal- vs process-orientation
* systems thinking
  * positive and negative feedback
     * cognition and epistemology
     * Metcalfe's law and other network effects
     * technilogical lock-in (+)
       * Facebook
       * Betamax, laser discs
       * start-up failure
       * Word, Excel vs WordPerfect, Lotus
